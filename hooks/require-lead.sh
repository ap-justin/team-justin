# pretooluse on every tool: the mechanized half of the lead contract's own
# precondition — skills/lead/SKILL.md loaded before building, reviewing or
# dispatching a seat, which /kru:setup writes into a repo's
# .claude/CLAUDE.md as a line the model may or may not act on. an instruction is
# discretionary and a hook is not.
#
# it gates the first tool call it sees, with one carve-out: a session edits
# through bash as readily as through Edit or Write — sed -i, a heredoc, git
# apply — so bash is gated too, but a bash command that only *reads* is not a
# build, and a config or triage turn that will never dispatch a seat should not
# pay the contract's price to run `cat`. every verb has to read, or the gate
# stands; anything unparsed keeps it, because a miss here is a silent ungated
# build and a false gate costs one message.
#
# it fires once per session: the mark is written whether or not the block lands,
# so a session that declines is nagged no further and a subagent's own tool call
# never trips a gate meant for the lead.
#
# fail open on anything that isn't a clear miss. kill switch: touch the file
# ~/.claude/kru/lead-gate/off. a marker file rather than a flag alone, because
# a bypass flag typed into a command string is what the harness's auto-mode
# classifier denies — the env var is honoured too, where auto mode is off.
