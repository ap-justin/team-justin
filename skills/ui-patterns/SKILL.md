description: House rules for how a component behaves — when a form validates and where a failed submit puts focus, where a mutation reports its outcome, what a per-row control announces, how an icon sits beside a label that wraps, what prose to leave out. Design-system agnostic: behavior, semantics and grouping only, never appearance. Load the one group matching your build target.

Match what you're about to build in the index, load that **one** `reference/` group, leave the rest. Most patterns don't apply to most components, so loading the corpus is the failure this index exists to prevent.

Each entry states the pattern, then the **default it corrects** — the thing that gets written when nobody consults the file. Read the second field as recognition: if it describes what you were about to do, the entry is for you.

## The index

| About to build | Load |
|---|---|
| a form · a submit button · validation · a checkbox, radio or switch and the words beside it · anything that mutates and has to report back | `reference/forms-and-mutations.md` |
| a control that repeats per row — Remove, Edit, a per-row menu | `reference/lists-and-rows.md` |
| an icon beside a label · helper text under a control · a caption · prose introducing a section | `reference/text-and-icons.md` |

One file is the normal load for a slice, two where it spans a form and the list it sits in. Nothing matched? `grep -ril "<term>" reference/`, then build it your way and name the gap in your return — silence here is an unwritten pattern, not a ruling.

## Applying one
- **Every entry here decides what a component does; the design system decides how it looks.** Sequence, semantics, grouping, where focus lands, where feedback reports — that's this corpus, and all of it holds whatever the project's system says. Appearance is the token file's alone (below). A pattern here that reads like a look is a pattern to raise in your return.
- **A pattern is a default, not a law.** A stated override answers it — a comment above the code, `CLAUDE.md`, the plan the lead handed down. Where you disagree and have no override, follow the pattern and raise it in your return.

## Owned elsewhere
- **Appearance** — color, spacing, type, radius, elevation, duration, the rank a control takes, what a focus indicator or a selected row looks like: the project's token file, via the `## Design system` pointer.
- **Whether a CSS feature is safe here** — `modern-css` owns Baseline status and fallbacks.
- **An accessible primitive's anatomy** — dialogs, comboboxes, date pickers: `ark-ui`, or the repo's existing library.
- **Whether the journey works** — `ux-principles`, audited by `ux-auditor`. This corpus is the component in front of you, not the path through the product.
